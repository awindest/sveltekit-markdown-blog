## Some technologies that I use today:

- VS Code for my editor
- [Svelte/SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) for my framework as it merges back-end and front-end nicely
- HTML, obviously
- CSS, went down the Bootstrap -> tailwind -> vanilla -> [open-props.style](https://open-props.style) CSS path. I've settled on open-props, mainly because I'm not a designer and it is easy to use and stays out of my way. (going to therapy after migrating from Bootstrap 4 to Bootstrap 5)
- Javascript/Node.js, needed to access database/files so had to move to server-based [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) over npm as it is faster and a more disk efficient package manager
- [D3](https://d3js.org) for data visualizations, but now it is more utilitarian as svelte is declarative and easier to manipulate the DOM
- [Observable](https://observablehq.com) for data visualizations
- [threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) (svelte and three.js) for exploring 3d spaces
- [gsap](https://gsap.com)(GreenSock Animation Platform) for complex animations
- chrome is my target web browser but I am learning how to automate testing on all browsers, just need to remember where I read how to do that.
- python for data engineering and data science
- a little databricks for data engineering and data science
- RSS
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com), free tier to see what production deployments look like
- [Docker](https://docker.com) to spin up various technologies like databases or kali
- [Github](https://github.com) for storage, backup and version control
- `git` from the command line as I don't trust myself with the GUI version
- [`drizzle`](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for a Typescript ORM
- [`turso`](https://turso.tech/) an SQLite Database as a service (free tier)
- [`figma`](https://www.figma.com/) for some graphics work
- [`blender`](https://www.blender.org/) for 3D models especially the dioramas, love dioramas
- [`sketchfab`](https://sketchfab.com/feed) for 3d models
- pending - Suprabase to store blog posts
- pending - PocketHost.io to store blog posts in pocketbase but not able to get my account working
